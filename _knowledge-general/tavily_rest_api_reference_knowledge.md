      "raw_content": "Contents\nArtificial intelligence\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines or software, as opposed to the intelligence of humans or animals. It is a field of study in computer science that develops and studies intelligent machines. \"AI\" may also refer to the machines themselves.\nAI technology is widely used throughout industry, government and science. Some high-profile applications are: advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), and competing at the highest level in strategy games (such as chess and Go).[1]\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.[2] The field went through multiple cycles of optimism[3][4] followed by disappointment and loss of funding,[5][6] but after 2012, when deep learning surpassed all previous AI techniques,[7] there was a vast increase in funding and interest.\nThe various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics.[a] General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals.[8]\nTo solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics.[b] AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience and many other fields.[9]\nGoals\nThe general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.[a]\nReasoning, problem-solving\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.[10] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.[11]\nMany of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger.[12]\nEven humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.[13]\nAccurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.\nKnowledge representation\nKnowledge representation and knowledge engineering[14] allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval,[15] scene interpretation,[16] clinical decision support,[17] knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases),[18] and other areas.[19]\nA knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge.[20] Knowledge bases need to represent things such as:\nobjects, properties, categories and relations between objects;\n[21]\nsituations, events, states and time;[22]\ncauses and effects;[23]\nknowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);[24]\ndefault reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing);[25] and many other aspects and domains of knowledge.\nAmong the most difficult problems in KR are: the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous);[26] and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally).[13]\nKnowledge acquisition is the difficult problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.[c] Modern AI gathers knowledge by \"scraping\" the internet (including Wikipedia). The knowledge itself was collected by the volunteers and professionals who published the information (who may or may not have agreed to provide their work to AI companies).[29] This \"crowd sourced\" technique does not guarantee that the knowledge is correct or reliable. The knowledge of Large Language Models (such as ChatGPT) is highly unreliable -- it generates misinformation and falsehoods (known as \"hallucinations\"). Providing accurate knowledge for these modern AI applications is an unsolved problem.\nPlanning and decision making\nAn \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen.[d][30]\nIn automated planning, the agent has a specific goal.[31] In automated decision making, the agent has preferences – there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \"utility\") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \"expected utility\": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.[32]\nIn classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be.[33]\nIn most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is \"unknown\" or \"unobservable\") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.[34]\nIn some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning) or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences.[35]\nInformation value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions.[36]\nThe space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain what the outcome will be.\nA Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way, and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g. by iteration), be heuristic, or it can be learned.[37]\nGame theory describes rational behavior of multiple interacting agents, and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents.[38]\nLearning\nMachine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically.[39]\nIt has been a part of AI from the beginning.[e]\nThere are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance.[42]\nSupervised learning requires a human to label the input data first, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).[43]\nIn reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\".[44]\nTransfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.[45] Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning.[46]\nComputational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.[47]\nNatural language processing\nNatural language processing (NLP)[48] allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages such as English.\nSpecific problems include speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, information extraction, information retrieval and question answering.[49]\nEarly work, based on Noam Chomsky's generative grammar and semantic networks, had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation[f]\nunless restricted to small domains called \"micro-worlds\" (due to the common sense knowledge problem[26]).\nModern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning),[50] transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism),[51] and others.[52] In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or \"GPT\") language models began to generate coherent text,[53][54] and by 2023 these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam, SAT, GRE, and many other real-world applications.[55]\nPerception\nMachine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.[56]\nThe field includes speech recognition,[57]\nimage classification,[58]\nfacial recognition, object recognition,[59]\nand robotic perception.[60]\nSocial intelligence\nAffective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process or simulate human feeling, emotion and mood.[62]\nFor example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction.\nHowever, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of how intelligent existing computer agents actually are.[63] Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein AI classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject.[64]\nGeneral intelligence\nA machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence.[8]\nTools\nAI research uses a wide variety of tools to accomplish the goals above.[b]\nSearch and optimization\nAI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions.[65] There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search.\nState space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state.[66]\nFor example, Planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis.[67]\nSimple exhaustive searches[68]\nare rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes.[12]\n\"Heuristics\" or \"rules of thumb\" can help to prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal.[69]\nAdversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and counter-moves, looking for a winning position.[70]\nLocal search uses mathematical optimization to find a numeric solution to a problem. It begins with some form of a guess and then refines the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. This process is called stochastic gradient descent.[71]\nEvolutionary computation uses a form of optimization search. For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses).[72]\nDistributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails).[73]\nNeural networks and statistical classifiers (discussed below), also use a form of local search, where the \"landscape\" to be searched is formed by learning.\nLogic\nFormal Logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation.[74]\nFormal logic comes in two main forms: propositional logic (which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as \"and\", \"or\", \"not\" and \"implies\")[75]\nand predicate logic (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as \"Every X is a Y\" and \"There are some Xs that are Ys\").[76]\nLogical inference (or deduction) is the process of proving a new statement (conclusion) from other statements that are already known to be true (the premises).[77]\nA logical knowledge base also handles queries and assertions as a special case of inference.[78]\nAn inference rule describes what is a valid step in a proof. The most general inference rule is resolution.[79]\nInference can be reduced to performing a search to find a path that leads from premises to conclusions, where each step is the application of an inference rule.[80]\nInference performed this way is intractable except for short proofs in restricted domains. No efficient, powerful and general method has been discovered.[81]\nFuzzy logic assigns a \"degree of truth\" between 0 and 1 and handles uncertainty and probabilistic situations.[82]\nNon-monotonic logics are designed to handle default reasoning.[25]\nOther specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains (see knowledge representation above).\nProbabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning\nMany problems in AI (including in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.[83]\nBayesian networks[84]\nare a very general tool that can be used for many problems, including reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm),[g][86]\nlearning (using the expectation-maximization algorithm),[h][88]\nplanning (using decision networks)[89]\nand perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).[90]\nProbabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters).[90]\nPrecise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis,[91]\nand information value theory.[92]\nThese tools include models such as Markov decision processes,\n[93]\ndynamic decision networks,[90]\ngame theory and mechanism design.[94]\nClassifiers and statistical learning methods\nThe simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g. \"if shiny then diamond\"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g. \"if diamond then pick up\"), on the other hand. Classifiers[95]\nare functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning. Each pattern (also called an \"observation\") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.[43]\nThere are many kinds of classifiers in use. The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm.[96] K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s.[97]\nThe naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\"[98] at Google, due in part to its scalability.[99]\nNeural networks are also used as classifiers.[100]\nArtificial neural networks\nArtificial neural networks[100] were inspired by the design of the human brain: a simple \"neuron\" N accepts input from other neurons, each of which, when activated (or \"fired\"), casts a weighted \"vote\" for or against whether neuron N should itself activate. In practice, the input \"neurons\" are a list of numbers, the \"weights\" are a matrix, the next layer is the dot product (i.e., several weighted sums) scaled by an increasing function, such as the logistic function. \"The resemblance to real neural cells and structures is superficial\", according to Russell and Norvig.[101][i]\nLearning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm.[102]\nNeural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function.[103]\nIn feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction.[104]\nRecurrent neural networks feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events. Long short term memory is the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks.[105]\nPerceptrons[106]\nuse only a single layer of neurons, deep learning[107] uses multiple layers.\nConvolutional neural networks strengthen the connection between neurons that are \"close\" to each other – this is especially important in image processing, where a local set of neurons must identify an \"edge\" before the network can identify an object.[108]\nDeep learning\nDeep learning[107]\nuses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs. The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces.[110]\nDeep learning has drastically improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, image classification[111]\nand others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2023.[112]\nThe sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s)[j]\nbut because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet.[k]\nSpecialized hardware and software\nIn the late 2010s, graphics processing units (GPUs) that were increasingly designed with AI-specific enhancements and used with specialized TensorFlow software, had replaced previously used central processing unit (CPUs) as the dominant means for large-scale (commercial and academic) machine learning models' training.[121]\nHistorically, specialized languages, such as Lisp, Prolog, and others, had been used.\nApplications\nAI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including:
